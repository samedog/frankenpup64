12.10.1

 - merge lp:~charlesk/libindicator/lp-1045372 to remove the 'cloak'
   code that caused libreoffice's menubars in unity  to be greyed
   out after opening any dialog or switching windows (lp: 1045372)

12.10.0

 - merge lp:~evgeni/libindicator/multiarch-same-devheaders so that we
   don't include build-time filenames in comments of the enum header
   files. If we do, the header files may be different on each build.
   This is especially harmful when building multiple times for multiple
   architectures and expecting the files to be identical.

 - merge lp:~charlesk/libindicator/fix-test-sources to fix a 
   copy-and-paste error in specifying the tests' source files

 - merge lp:~charlesk/libindicator/cxx to constify the constructors
   for indicator_service_manager
